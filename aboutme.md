title: About me
---

I'm a father to two awesome little boys, a co-founder of a software development consultancy and a fairly keen cyclist.

My work is focussed on building .Net based web applications for companies of varying sizes. As a result, I know an awful lot about building software in .Net and on Azure. I'm also the main contributor to a C# ORM called [Dashing](http://polylytics.github.io/dashing/).

In the past I've worked for a couple of management consultancies, gained an MSC Computing (AI) at Imperial College, an MPhys Physics at Oxford and travelled around the world in 6 fun-filled months.
